- **Payment Service**: Complete payment processing service with transaction tracking
- **Usage Tracking**: Real-time usage statistics and conversion history
- **Payment History**: Full payment transaction logging and retrieval

### 3. Enhanced JSON Parsing
- **Robust Parser**: Improved AI response parsing with multiple fallback mechanisms
- **Text Extraction**: Fallback text parsing when JSON parsing fails
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with meaningful fallbacks
- **Validation**: Field validation to ensure response completeness

### 4. User Interface Updates
- **Authentication Modal**: Complete sign up/sign in modal with form validation
- **Navigation Updates**: User status display, payment information, and auth controls

4. **Usage Tracking**: Real-time updates of free/paid conversion counts
5. **Payment History**: Complete transaction log available

## 🔒 Security Features

- Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
- User data isolation
- Secure API key management
- Authentication required for all operations
- Input validation and sanitization

## 🧪 Testing Status

- ✅ All existing tests passing
- ✅ Paper service functionality verified
- ✅ Development server running successfully
- ✅ Core features operational

## 📋 Setup Requirements

### Environment Variables
```env
VITE_OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### Database Setup
1. Create Supabase project
2. Run `supabase-schema.sql` in SQL editor
3. Configure authentication settings
4. Set up environment variables

## 🚀 Deployment Considerations

### Production Setup
- Configure production Supabase instance
- Set up proper CORS settings
- Configure email templates
- Set up monitoring and analytics

### Payment Integration
- Current implementation uses demo payment processing
- For production, integrate with:
  - Stripe for credit card processing
  - PayPal for alternative payments
  - Webhook handling for payment confirmations

## 📈 Future Enhancements

### Immediate Improvements
- Real payment processor integration (Stripe/PayPal)
- Email notifications for payments
- Usage analytics dashboard
- Subscription tier upgrades

### Advanced Features
- Team collaboration features
- API access for paid tiers
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Custom pricing for enterprise

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
- Demo payment processing (not real transactions)
- Basic email templates
- Limited analytics dashboard
- No webhook handling yet

### Recommended Fixes
- Integrate real payment processor
- Set up proper email service
- Add comprehensive monitoring
- Implement webhook endpoints
